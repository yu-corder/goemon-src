# Goemon (五右衛門)

Goemon is a stack-machine-based virtual machine and compiler implemented in C. 
It is designed to explore low-level system architecture and compiler theory through a hands-on, minimalist approach.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Stack-Machine Architecture**: A custom VM that executes instructions based on stack operations.
- **Recursive Descent Parsing**: A robust parsing engine where the grammar rules are directly mapped to C functions, enabling clean and extensible syntax analysis.
- **Variable & Arithmetic Support**: Supports variable memory allocation and infinite arithmetic expressions (e.g., `a = 1 + 2 + 3;`).
- **Centralized Bytecode Generation**: Uses an `emit_op` abstraction to ensure consistent and reliable bytecode output.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language**: C
- **Architecture**: Stack Machine
- **Parsing Strategy**: Recursive Descent (Top-down parsing)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✨ Example

```text
b = 105 + 1051 + 1051;
print b;
```

```text
2207
```

### Compilation
You can compile the project using `gcc` directly or via the `Makefile`.

**Option 1: Using make (Recommended)**
```bash
make
```
